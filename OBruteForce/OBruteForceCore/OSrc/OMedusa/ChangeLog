Medusa Core Updates:
  -Display module list sorted alphabetically
  -Compiles on OpenBSD
  -Added delayed receive functions which allow the modules to specify the timeout
   for both the initial socket read and the second "is any more data there?" check.
  -Modified SSL connect function. The function now takes an already existing socket 
   and switches it over to SSL. This is needed for modules like VMAUTHD.

   we should actually be able to brute devices with long logon banners now.
