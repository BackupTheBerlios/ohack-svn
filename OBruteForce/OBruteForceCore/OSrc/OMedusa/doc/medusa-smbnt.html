<H1>Medusa Parallel Network Login Auditor :: SMBNT</H1>
<I>JoMo-Kun / jmk "AT" foofus "DOT" net</I><BR>
<HR>

<P>
The SMBNT module tests accounts against the Microsoft <I>netbios-ssn</I> 
(TCP/139) and <I>microsoft-ds</I> (TCP/445) services. Besides testing
normal passwords, this module allows Medusa to directly test NTLM hashes 
against a Windows host. This may be useful for an auditor who has aquired
a sam._ or pwdump file and would like to quickly determine which are valid 
entries.

<P>
Several "-m 'METHOD:VALUE'" options can be used with this module. The
following are valid methods: GROUP, GROUP_OTHER, PASS and NETBIOS.
The following values are useful for these methods:

  <TD>Check both. This leaves the workgroup field set blank and then 
      attempts to check the credentials against the host. If the account 
      does not exist locally on the host being tested, that host then queries
      its domain controller.</TD>

<P>
The following examples demonstrate several uses of the SMBNT module:

<UL>
<LI>The default behavior is to test NATIVE Win2000 mode via TCP/445. If this 
connection fails, NETBIOS mode is checked on TCP/139. The following shows how 
to force the module into NETBIOS module. 

<PRE><CODE>
% medusa -h 192.168.0.20 -u administrator -e ns -M smbnt -m NETBIOS -n 139 
Medusa v1.0-rc1 [http://www.foofus.net] (C) JoMo-Kun / Foofus Networks

ACCOUNT CHECK: [smbnt] Host: 192.168.0.20 (1/1) User: administrator (1/1) Password:  (1/2)
ACCOUNT CHECK: [smbnt] Host: 192.168.0.20 (1/1) User: administrator (1/1) Password: administrator (2/2)
</PRE></CODE>

<LI>The following example shows how to force to module to set a domain value
other than either "localhost" or the system's default domain. This can be useful
when testing trust relationships between domains.

<PRE><CODE>
% medusa -h 192.168.0.20 -u foo -p bar -M smbnt -m GROUP_OTHER:FOODOM
Medusa v1.0-rc1 [http://www.foofus.net] (C) JoMo-Kun / Foofus Networks 

ACCOUNT CHECK: [smbnt] Host: 192.168.0.20 (1/1) User: foo (1/1) Password: bar (1/1)
</PRE></CODE>

<LI>This example demonstrates one way that PwDump output could be used with
Medusa. Each user and their respective NTLM hash within the pwdump.txt file
will be tested against the hosts listed in hosts.txt.<BR>

<PRE><CODE>
% medusa -H hosts.txt -C pwdump.txt -M smbnt -m PASS:HASH

Medusa v1.0-rc1 [http://www.foofus.net] (C) JoMo-Kun / Foofus Networks

ACCOUNT CHECK: [smbnt] Host: 192.168.0.20 (1/10) User: Administrator (1/3) Password: 92D887C8010492C2944E2DF489A880E4:7A2EDE4F51BC5A03984C6BA2C239CF63::: (1/1)
ACCOUNT FOUND: [smbnt] Host: 192.168.0.20 User: Administrator Password: 92D887C8010492C2944E2DF489A880E4:7A2EDE4F51BC5A03984C6BA2C239CF63::: [SUCCESS]
ACCOUNT CHECK: [smbnt] Host: 192.168.0.20 (1/10) User: bar (2/3) Password: 49D58563113416EBAAD3B435B51404EE:AA3AFE73B6E0C2D87B3A428BF696AE71::: (1/1)
ACCOUNT CHECK: [smbnt] Host: 192.168.0.20 (1/10) User: foo (3/3) Password: 92D887C8010492C2944E2DF489A880E4:7A2EDE4F51BC5A03984C6BA2C239CF63::: (1/1)
ACCOUNT FOUND: [smbnt] Host: 192.168.0.20 User: foo Password: 92D887C8010492C2944E2DF489A880E4:7A2EDE4F51BC5A03984C6BA2C239CF63::: [SUCCESS]
&lt snip &gt
</PRE></CODE>

It should be noted that once a valid hash is located, it is often not necessary
to "crack" the password in order to use it. Using a modified SAMBA client, the
hash can just be "passed" directly. See <A HREF="http://www.foofus.net/jmk/passhash.html">
this page</A> for a SAMBA patch and several examples.

<P>
Be careful of mass domain account lockout with this module. For example, assume 
you are checking several accounts against many domain workstations. If you are 
using either the "GROUP:DOMAIN" or the "GROUP:BOTH" option and these accounts do 
not exist locally on the workstations, each workstation will in turn check their
respective domain controller. This could cause a bunch of lockouts. Of course, 
it'd look like the workstations, not you, were doing it. ;)

<P>
FYI, this code is unable to test accounts on default XP hosts which are not part 
of a domain and do not have normal file sharing enabled. Default XP does not allow 
shares and returns STATUS_LOGON_FAILED for both valid and invalid credentials. XP 
with simple sharing enabled returns SUCCESS for both valid and invalid credentials. 
If anyone knows a way to test in these configurations...
